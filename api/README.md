# o!TR API

Welcome to the documentation of the o!TR API project. You can use this API to obtain data on human-verified osu! tournaments and tournament players. Please, use the API for good!

At the moment, consider this documentation to be in a state of constant evolution as we continue to refine our systems during this pre-release phase.

If you encounter errors in this documentation or in the API, please check the [issues](https://github.com/osu-tournament-rating/otr-api/issues) section of the API repository for any existing bugs. If you don't find an existing issue, feel free to make one yourself! When in doubt, err on the side of issue creation.
