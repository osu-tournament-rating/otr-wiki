# API Terms of Use

You should be using the API for good! Please join the [o!TR Discord](https://discord.gg/R53AwX2tJA) and ping Stage for access. You must explain what you plan to use the API for and why we should grant you access. Keep in mind that API access is *extremely* limited at this time.

A few notes from the devs:
- Do not scrape data from our API / attempt to reconstruct our database. If we suspect this is happening, your access will be blocked permanently.
- Do not use the API as a means to trick people into thinking your application is an official o!TR application.


## Ratelimit

The initial ratelimit will be set to 30 requests per minute. We do not have server capacity to support a huge amount of requests from all users. Specific clients may be given a custom ratelimit on a case-by-case basis. As we learn more about performance, we can look into increasing this limit in the future.
