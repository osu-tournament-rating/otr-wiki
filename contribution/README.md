# o!TR Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the osu! Tournament Rating project. We greatly appreciate all contributions and feedback!

## General Feedback

General feedback can be left under each repository's discussion page. Here, you can ask questions, voice concerns, and more while engaging in productive dialogue with the o!TR team. We prefer using Github's discussions feature instead of Discord-based communications.

## Code Contributions

We accept code contributions from all, though we will expect them to be of good quality. Changes must be tested locally by developers before opening a PR with accompanying unit tests where necessary.

Before making a PR, please do one of the following:

- If the feature or bug does not have an issue, please first create an issue describing the problem. Note your intention to create a PR for this issue in the description. Please wait for a maintainer to approve before proceeding.
- If the feature or bug does have an issue, leave a comment expressing your desire to work on it. Please wait for a maintainer to approve before proceeding.

If your topic is broad in scope, we encourage the usage of discussions instead of issues.

### Recognition

Staff members, developers, QA testers, and anyone with significant contributions to the o!TR project are recognized in our [contributors list](contributors/en.md). We appreciate all those who contribute to making this project a reality!
